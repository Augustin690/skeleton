<p>Welcome to the Student Grade Application. The goal of this lab session is to
make the Web application work by desiging a database schema and filling in the
missing queries in the "models.py" file. Of course, clicking the links in the
menu at the top of the page will not work properly until you have completed the
corresponding queries.</p>
